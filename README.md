HARNESSING NLP FOR ENERGY DEMAND FORECASTING

Overview
This project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to forecast energy demand more accurately. By analyzing textual data from various sources such as weather reports, news articles, and social media, we seek to improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts, ultimately contributing to better resource allocation and energy management strategies.

Motivation
Traditional energy demand forecasting methods often rely solely on numerical data such as historical consumption patterns, economic indicators, and weather forecasts. However, these methods may overlook valuable insights embedded in textual data sources. By integrating NLP into the forecasting process, we aim to capture the nuanced relationships between linguistic expressions and energy demand trends, thus enhancing the forecasting accuracy.

Key Features
Text Data Integration:
Incorporate textual data from diverse sources, including weather reports, news articles, social media posts, etc.

NLP Techniques: Apply various NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition to extract valuable insights from textual data.

Machine Learning Models:
Develop machine learning models to incorporate NLP-derived features and improve energy demand forecasting accuracy.

Visualization:
Visualize forecasted energy demand trends and NLP-derived insights to facilitate decision-making and resource allocation.
